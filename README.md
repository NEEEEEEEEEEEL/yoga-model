Sentiment Analysis-based Yoga Routine Recommendation System
This project provides a simple system that recommends yoga routines based on the user's mood. By analyzing the sentiment of the user's input text, it suggests different yoga poses to align with their emotional state. The sentiment is determined using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the user's mood (positive, neutral, negative) from input text.
Yoga Recommendations: Maps sentiment to a list of recommended yoga poses to match the user's emotional state.
Simple Interface: User inputs their feelings, and the system responds with relevant yoga poses.
How It Works
The user provides a text input describing their emotional state (e.g., "I'm feeling great!" or "I'm stressed out").
The text is passed to a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (using Hugging Face's transformers library).
Based on the sentiment of the input text (positive, neutral, or negative), the system recommends an appropriate yoga routine.
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/yoga-sentiment-analysis.git
cd yoga-sentiment-analysis
2. Set up the environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3. Install dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should include the necessary libraries like transformers, torch, etc.

Example requirements.txt:

makefile
Copy code
transformers==4.31.0
torch==2.0.0
4. Run the program
After setting up the environment and installing the dependencies, you can run the program using:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The program will prompt you for input, and based on your mood, it will suggest an appropriate yoga routine.

Code Overview
1. Sentiment Analysis
We use the transformers library from Hugging Face to load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
2. Yoga Routine Mapping
We define yoga routines for each sentiment (positive, neutral, and negative):

python
Copy code
yoga_routines = {
    "positive": ["Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar)", "Backbends (e.g., Cobra Pose)", "Warrior Poses"],
    "neutral": ["Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)", "Cat-Cow Stretch (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana)", "Tree Pose (Vrikshasana)"],
    "negative": ["Child's Pose (Balasana)", "Legs-Up-The-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)", "Corpse Pose (Savasana)"]
}
3. Recommendation Logic
The sentiment analysis result is processed, and the corresponding yoga routine is returned:

python
Copy code
def recommend_yoga_routine(user_text):
    sentiment = sentiment_analyzer(user_text)[0]
    label = sentiment["label"].lower()
    if "positive" in label:
        return yoga_routines["positive"]
    elif "negative" in label:
        return yoga_routines["negative"]
    else:
        return yoga_routines["neutral"]
Example Usage
Input:
vbnet
Copy code
How are you feeling today?
> I'm feeling really good today!
Output:
sql
Copy code
Based on your mood, here are some yoga routines for you:
Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar), Backbends (e.g., Cobra Pose), Warrior Poses
Input:
vbnet
Copy code
How are you feeling today?
> I'm feeling stressed and anxious.
Output:
rust
Copy code
Based on your mood, here are some yoga routines for you:
Child's Pose (Balasana), Legs-Up-The-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani), Corpse Pose (Savasana)
Model Information
This system uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's transformers library, which provides powerful models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis model predicts one of the following labels:

POSITIVE: The text indicates a positive sentiment.
NEGATIVE: The text indicates a negative sentiment.
NEUTRAL: The text does not lean towards a particular sentiment.
Next Steps
Improve Yoga Routine Suggestions: Add more yoga poses and routines for different emotional states, or make them more dynamic.
Expand Input Options: Allow users to select mood options (happy, sad, stressed) rather than entering text.
Mobile App Integration: Integrate this system into a mobile yoga app to provide real-time suggestions based on user mood.
User Feedback: Collect feedback on the recommendations and continuously improve the routine suggestions based on user responses.
